# AES-CBC Encryption Example

This example demonstrates how to use the AES-CBC encryption algorithm to encrypt and decrypt data, as well as perform various cryptographic operations. AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a symmetric encryption algorithm widely used to secure data.

## What is AES-CBC?

AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a symmetric encryption algorithm widely used to secure data. CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) is a mode of AES that enhances security by XORing each plaintext block with the previous ciphertext block. The AES-CBC mode uses an initialization vector (IV) to ensure that the same plaintext produces different ciphertexts in different encryption processes.

### How CBC Works

1. **Initialization Vector (IV)**: The CBC mode requires a randomly generated IV. The IV ensures that the same plaintext produces different ciphertexts in different encryption processes.
2. **Encryption Process**:
   - The first plaintext block is XORed with the IV to produce an intermediate value.
   - This intermediate value is then encrypted to produce the first ciphertext block.
   - Subsequent plaintext blocks are XORed with the previous ciphertext block before encryption, producing the corresponding ciphertext blocks.
3. **Decryption Process**: During decryption, the same key and IV are used to decrypt each block, and the previous ciphertext block is XORed to recover the plaintext.

## Key Features

This example implements the following cryptographic operations:

1. AES-CBC encryption and decryption
2. Key generation and export/import
3. Key wrapping and unwrapping
4. Data digest calculation
5. RSA key pair generation
6. Digital signature and verification
7. Key derivation

## Use Cases

This technique is particularly useful in the following scenarios:

- Protecting sensitive data in transit, such as user information and payment details.
- Implementing secure API communication.
- Storing encrypted data to prevent unauthorized access.
- Secure key exchange and management.
- Digital signatures for data integrity and authenticity.
- Implementing secure password storage and verification systems.

## Security Best Practices

To ensure the security of AES-CBC encryption, follow these best practices:

1. Use a sufficiently long key (at least 256 bits).
2. Use a unique random IV for each encryption operation.
3. Securely manage keys to prevent leakage.
4. Rotate keys regularly to enhance security.
5. Combine with a message authentication code (like HMAC) to ensure data integrity.
6. Handle and store sensitive cryptographic material carefully.
7. Use a secure random number generator.

## Performance Considerations

When using AES-CBC encryption in edge functions, consider the following performance factors:

1. Computational overhead of encryption and decryption operations.
2. Resource consumption for key generation and management.
3. Additional overhead for data transmission (IV and possible padding).
4. Impact of caching strategies on encrypted content.

## Frequently Asked Questions

1. **Q: What are the advantages of AES-CBC compared to other AES modes?**
   A: AES-CBC provides good security and is relatively simple to implement. It's suitable for most general encryption scenarios.

2. **Q: How can I securely store and transmit encryption keys?**
   A: You can use a key management system (KMS) or hardware security modules (HSM) for secure key storage. For transmission, use secure channels like TLS.

3. **Q: Is AES-CBC suitable for streaming data encryption?**
   A: For streaming data, CTR or GCM modes might be more appropriate as they allow for parallel processing and random access.

By implementing AES-CBC encryption and other cryptographic operations in edge functions, you can effectively secure data and prevent it from being tampered with or stolen during transmission, while also providing a robust foundation for various security-related tasks.
